This is a random password generator made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The password generator should first ask the user how long the password should be, between 8-128 characters.
The password generator should not work if the user input is > 128 or < 8.

It then proceeds to ask whether the following parameters should be met in the creation of the passwords.
1. Uppercase characters
2. Lowercase characters
3. Numbers
4. Special characters

The password is then generated based off of the users input to the 5 parameters listed above and displayed as such:
